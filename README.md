## Summary

Image processing  aims to extract or interpret the information contained in the observed data linked to one (or more) image(s). Most of the analysis tools are based on the formulation of an objective function and the development of suitable optimization methods. These approaches, qualified as variational, have become the state-of-the-art for many image processing modalities, thanks to their ability to deal with large-scale problems, their versatility allowing them to be adapted to different contexts, as well as the associated theoretical results ensuring convergence towards a solution of the finite objective function.
The course has four parts: (i) Introduction to imaging problems, (ii) Optimization methods for imaging, (iii) Supervised learning for solving inverse problems and (iv) Application examples (Python lab ).

In the first part, we will explain why many imaging problems can be formulated as optimization problems. We will give examples from inverse problems, segmentation and supervised learning. We will see that in each case, the underlying optimization problems can be convex or non-convex, can involve linear operators having very varied structures and sometimes non-linear operators depending on the applications considered and the information available.
In the second part we will present the main classes of optimization algorithms used in image processing to solve the problems discussed in the first part. As these image analysis techniques can involve smooth and non-smooth functions, we will mainly discuss the proximal methods.
In a third part, we will focus on neural networks and their interest in solving inverse problems. We will present classical neural networks but also the principle of plug and play algorithms and unrolled algorithms.
Finally, we will devote the fourth part of this course to the implementation of certain algorithms to solve classical imaging problems.

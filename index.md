## Summary

Image processing  aims to extract or interpret the information contained in the observed data linked to one (or more) image(s). Most of the analysis tools are based on the formulation of an objective function and the development of suitable optimization methods. This class of approaches, qualified as variational, has become the state-of-the-art for many image processing modalities, thanks to their ability to deal with large-scale problems, their versatility allowing them to be adapted to different contexts, as well as the associated theoretical results ensuring convergence towards a solution of the finite objective function.
